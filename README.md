# 🧬 Epidemiological Data Mining – Critical Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive critical analysis of the research paper:  
**“Epidemiological Data Mining for Assisting with Foodborne Outbreak Investigation”** by Tao et al. (2023).  
It was submitted as part of the **Advanced Data and Network Mining (B9DA110)** module at **Dublin Business School**.

The study proposes a modern framework that combines **machine learning**, **text mining**, **network modeling**, and **Monte Carlo simulation** to improve foodborne outbreak investigations. The research addresses key limitations of traditional surveillance methods, especially their delay, lack of granularity, and underuse of unstructured data.
